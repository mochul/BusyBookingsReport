## Introduction/Background (10 points):

Provide an in-depth overview of Project 2's objectives and the chosen technology stack.
Offer an overview of the project's context and significance.
Define the project scope and your project management approach.
Discuss related work and how your project aligns with or diverges from existing solutions or methodologies.
Software Technologies (15 points):

Detail the technologies, frameworks, and AI tools used, including any crucial libraries or frameworks.
Discuss the rationale for selecting specific AI tools and design patterns.

## Requirements (20 Points):

Document both Functional and Non-Functional Requirements.
Make sure to mention the 4 MMFs in detail here
Discuss the process of identifying and prioritizing these requirements.
Design (30 Points):

Present architectural design diagrams.
Explain your design decisions and their impact.
Design Patterns Implementation (30 points):

Document the design patterns used, their justification, visual evidence of their usage, and their impact on the projectâ€™s structure and maintainability.

## Testing Strategy, Execution, AI tool analysis (60 points):

Overall, we took a two-pronged approach towards testing, splitting the testing across white-box and black-box both in methods and in purpose.
We mainly employed blackbox testing for system testing, ensuring that every key functionality was still up and running after every merge. We specifically
used decison table testing, a black-box testing method that uses a table to organize input combinations and their corresponding outcomes.
It's a technique used to identify the correct test cases for systems with complex business rules. This was perfect for our project as there were
very complex rules governing our logins, calendar, and booking system where both security and efficiency had to be balanced. After every merge 
we tested the application once again to ensure nothing broke and the new changes were implemented smoothly. When this was not the case, we would roll 
back the change and start over. 
Elaborate on the Test Strategy, including whitebox and blackbox testing methods. List various tools used for testing and explain their purpose.
Provide detailed test cases and their outcomes.
Discuss the AI tools used in blackbox and whitebox testing.
Offer a comparative analysis on the performance, usability, and impact of these tools on productivity and quality, including metrics and statistical evidence. (30 points)

## Challenges and Innovations (15 points):

Detail challenges faced during the project and the innovative solutions implemented. This could be related to adoption of AI tools, testing technologies or other things.
Highlight unique technological or methodological approaches that distinguished your project.
Project Outcomes and Evaluation (10 points):

Summarize the final outputs, emphasizing the effectiveness/non-effectiveness of AI tools in achieving project goals.
Critically assess the project outcomes relative to the initial objectives and provide a quantitative and qualitative evaluation.

## Future Directions (10 points):

Suggest potential enhancements or future research opportunities based on your findings.
Discuss possible improvements to AI tool usage or alternative tools that could be explored.
